# 1.9 Character Arrays

This section covers string manipulation using character arrays.

## Files:
- `longest_line.c`: Find and print longest input line
- `longest_line_arbitrary_length.c`: Handle lines longer than buffer (Exercise 1-16)
- `lines_longer_than_80.c`: Print lines longer than 80 characters (Exercise 1-17)
- `remove_trailing_blanks.c`: Remove trailing blanks and delete blank lines (Exercise 1-18)
- `reverse_string.c`: Reverse input lines (Exercise 1-19)

## Key Concepts:
- Character arrays for strings
- String termination with '\0'
- Array parameters in functions
- String manipulation algorithms
- Buffer management

## Compilation:
```bash
cc longest_line.c -o longest
./longest < input.txt
