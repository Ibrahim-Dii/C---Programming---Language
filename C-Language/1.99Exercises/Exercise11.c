/*Exercise 1-11: Testing Word Count Program
Test Cases:

Empty input → Should output: 0 0 0

Single word → Should output: 0 1 [char_count]

Multiple spaces between words → Should count words correctly

Tabs and newlines mixed → Should handle all whitespace

Input without trailing newline → Should still count last word

Very long input → Should not crash

Most likely bugs:

Off-by-one errors in counting

Not handling EOF properly

Incorrect word definition with punctuation
